# Joe's React Store

This React Store helps you to find your new favourite Botanical products - if you're into that sort of thing...<br />

In this project, props were needed to be passed down component trees (prop drilling), and data transmitted around using functions as props.. <br /> <br />

### Tech

This site uses the following languages, principles & softwares:

  - Functional React
  - HTML
  - SCSS / CSS
  
The project is open-source, so feel free to pick and choose bits you like to host on your own GitHub!

### Todos

 - Botanical search
 - PayPal Checkout
 
### Known Bugs

If the quantity of an item is changed inside the cart, the total cart balance does not update (this is to do with state not rerendering the component when changed) and will be changed in a future update
